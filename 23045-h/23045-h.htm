<p>This text of <i>Measure for Measure</i> is from Volume I of the
nine-volume 1863 Cambridge edition of Shakespeare. The Preface (<a class
= "external" href = "http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23041" target =
"_blank">e-text 23041</a>) and the other plays from this volume are each
available as separate e-texts.</p>

<p>General Notes are in their original location at the end of the play,
followed by the text-critical notes originally printed at the bottom of
each page. All notes are hyperlinked in both directions. In dialogue,
a&nbsp;link from a speaker’s name generally means that the note applies
to an entire line or group of lines.</p>

<p>Line numbers&mdash;shown in the right margin and used for all
notes&mdash;are from the original text. In prose passages the exact line
counts will depend on your browser settings, and will probably be
different from the displayed numbers. Stage directions were not included
in the line numbering.</p>

Shakespeare in familiar questions, but, as to the first and third

<p><a href = "#lineII_4_111">II. 4. 111-113.</a> Mr Sidney Walker adopts
Steevens’ emendation, and affirms that among all the metrical licenses
used by Shakespeare, the omission of the final syllable of the line is
not one. But if the reading of the first Folio be allowed to stand, we
can find many instances of lines which want the final syllable. The line
immediately preceding may be so scanned:</p>

<p class = "poem">
‘Ignomy in ransom and free pardon.’</p>

<p>And in this same scene, <a href = "#lineII_4_143">line 143</a>, we
have</p>

<p class = "poem">
‘And you tell me that he shall die for’t.’</p>

<p class = "poem">
‘The warrant’s for yourself; take heed to’t<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing">.’</ins></p>

<p>It is conceivable that ‘mercy’ may be pronounced as a trisyllable;
but in all the undoubted examples of such a metrical license, the liquid
is the second of the two consonants, not the first. See, however,
S.&nbsp;Walker’s <i>Shakespeare’s Versification</i>, pp. 207 sqq.</p>

<p>Possibly a word may have dropt out, and the original passage may have
stood thus:</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>‘Ignomy in ransom and free pardon are</p>
<p>Of two <i>opposed</i> houses: lawful mercy</p>
<p>Is nothing kin to foul redemption.’</p>

<p><a href = "#lineIII_1_54">III. 1. 56, 57.</a> The metrical

the Duke’s speech, ‘concealed,’ should be the first of a line which
would be interrupted by his exit. Perhaps, too, the true reading of the

<p><a href = "#lineIII_1_91">III. 1. 91, 94.</a> The word ‘prenzie,’

authority that it is better to seek to explain than to alter it. It may
be etymologically connected with ‘prin,’ in old French, meaning
‘demure;’ also with ‘princox,’ a&nbsp;‘coxcomb,’ and with the word
‘prender,’ which occurs more than once in Skelton: e.g.</p>

<p><a href = "#lineIV_2_91">IV. 2. 91.</a> This is a case in which we

modernizing the spelling. The metre requires ‘Haply’ to be pronounced as
a trisyllable. Perhaps it would be well to retain the spelling of the
first two Folios ‘Happely,’ and as a general rule it would be convenient
if an obsolete spelling were retained in words used with an obsolete
meaning. We have, however, abstained from introducing on our own
authority this, or any other innovation in orthography. In <a href =
"#lineIV_3_126">IV. 3. 126</a>, we have retained ‘covent,’ which had
grown to be a distinct word from ‘convent,’ and differently pronounced.

<p>Perhaps the best arrangement, because requiring the least change from
the printing of the Folio, would be to put the words ‘And Claudio’ in a
line by themselves. Many examples of such a broken line in the middle of
a speech may be found (e.g. <a href = "#lineV_1_448">V. 1. 448</a>), and
it would add to the emphasis with which the Duke commends Claudio to the
Provost’s care. The long line <a href = "#lineV_1_465">V. 1. 465</a>,

any harm to ‘Friar Peter:’ for why should the Duke unnecessarily trust
two in an affair which required only one? The name of Friar Thomas is
never mentioned in the dialogue, and therefore seems arbitrarily placed
at the head of the scene.”</p>

<p>The general Preface (<a class = "external" href =
"http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23041" target = "_blank">e-text
23041</a>) discusses the
17th- and 18th-century editions in detail; the newer (19th-century)
editions are simply listed by name. The following editions may appear in
the Notes. All inset text is quoted from the Preface.</p>

<p><b>Folios</b>:<br>
F<sub>1</sub> 1623; F<sub>2</sub> (no date given); F<sub>3</sub> 1663;
F<sub>4</sub> 1685.</p>
<p class = "inset">
“The five plays contained in this volume occur in the first Folio in the
same order, and ... were there printed for the first time.”</p>

<p><b>Early editions</b>:<br>
Rowe 1709<br>
Pope 1715</p>
<p class = "inset">
“Pope was the first to indicate the <i>place</i> of each new scene; as,
for instance, <i>Tempest</i>, I. 1. ‘On a ship at sea.’ He also
subdivided the scenes as given by the Folios and Rowe, making a fresh
scene whenever a new character entered&mdash;an arrangement followed by
Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson. For convenience of reference to these
editions, we have always recorded the commencement of Pope’s
scenes.”</p>
